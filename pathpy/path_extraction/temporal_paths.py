    """
    Calculates the frequency of time-respecting paths up to maximum length
    of maxLength, assuming a maximum temporal distance of delta between consecutive
    time-stamped links on a path. This method uses a fast but heuristic approach that
    only considers the FIRST continuation of a time-respecting path. I.e., for time-
    stamped links (a,b,1), (b,c,5), (b,d,7) and a delta=6 only the time-respecting
    path (a,b,c) will be found, while (a,b,d) is ignored. If the next time-stamp includes 
    two possible continuations, i.e. (b,c,5) and (b,d,5), only the path continued by the first 
    edge will be used.
    
    This (static) method returns an instance of the class Paths, which can
    be used to generate higher- and multi-order models of time-respecting paths.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tempnet : pathpy.TemporalNetwork
        TemporalNetwork to extract the path from
    delta : int
        Indicates the maximum temporal distance up to which time-stamped
        links will be considered to contribute to time-respecting paths.
        For (u, v;3) and (v,w;7) a time-respecting path (u,v)->(v,w) will be inferred
        for all 0 < delta <= 4, while no time-respecting path will be inferred for all
        delta > 4. If the max time diff is not set specifically, the default value of
        delta=1 will be used, meaning that a time-respecting path u -> v -> w will
        only be inferred if there are *directly consecutive* time-stamped links
        (u,v;t) (v,w;t+1). Every time-stamped edge is further considered a path of
        length one, i.e. for maxLength=1 this function will simply return the
        statistics of time-stamped edges.
    max_length : int
        Indicates the maximum length up to which time-respecting paths should be
        calculated, which can be limited due to computational efficiency.
        A value of k will generate all time-respecting paths consisting of up to k
        time-stamped links. Note that generating a multi-order model with a maximum
        order of k requires to extract time-respecting paths with *at least* length k.
        If a limitation of the maxLength is not required for computational reasons,
        this parameter should not be set (as it will change the statistics of paths)
    max_subpath_length : int
        This can be used to limit the calculation of sub path statistics to a given
        maximum length. This is useful, as the statistics of sub paths of length k
        are only needed to fit a higher-order model with order k. Hence, if we know
        that the model selection is limited to a given maximum order K, we can safely
        set the maximum sub path length to K. By default, sub paths of any length
        will be calculated. Note that, independent of the sub path calculation
        longest path of any length will be considered in the likelihood calculation!
